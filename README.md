noqa is an AI agent that tests mobile apps and games from natural-language test cases. It works purely from screenshots — with no accessibility tree or view hierarchy — and controls the real app on iOS and Android devices, simulators, or in the cloud, returning per-step pass/fail with video and screenshots.

- **Any framework, even games — no locators** — native, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, and non-native UI (maps, canvases, WebViews, ads) all test the same, with no locators or scripts.
- **CLI with automatic grounding** — your coding agent drives a real device from the terminal: read the screen, act by plain-language description (noqa grounds it — no coordinates), and manage test cases.

  `noqa action tap -d "Blue login button at the bottom"`
- **Runs on real devices** — plus simulators, emulators, and cloud devices.

## Quick start

**1. Install the app.** [Download noqa](https://cdn.noqa.ai/app/macos/releases/latest/noqa.dmg) and keep it running — the CLI talks to it locally.

**2. Install the CLI and skill.** In the app, open **Settings → Tools → Install CLI** (adds `noqa` to your `PATH`) — and click **Install skill** too, so your coding agent knows the commands out of the box. Restart your terminal afterward. The skill also lives here in [`skills/noqa-testing`](skills/noqa-testing) if you'd rather add it manually.

**3. Connect a device.** List devices, pick one, and connect:

```bash
noqa devices ios                       # list iOS devices & simulators (or: noqa devices android)
noqa devices connect <device-id>       # connect to one from the list
```

**4. Get your app on the device.** Install your build (Xcode, Expo, Android Studio) and bring it to the foreground:

```bash
noqa action activate-app --bundle-id com.example.app
```

**5. Debug it in an inspect → act → verify loop.**

```bash
noqa screen                                    # inspect: read the current UI as a structured element tree
noqa action tap -d "Login button"              # act: one step, by description — grounding (recommended)
noqa action tap --x 500 --y 320                # …or by relative coordinates (0–1000) as a fallback
noqa screen                                    # verify: confirm the state changed as expected
```

## CLI

Point your coding agent at the CLI and it drives the device in a tight **inspect → act → verify** loop — read the screen, take one action, check the result, repeat. Two command groups make up the loop.

### Reading the screen

```bash
noqa screen                 # cleaned element tree — meaningful elements with relative coordinates (0–1000)
noqa screen --full          # raw Appium accessibility tree, unfiltered
noqa screenshot ./shot.png  # save a screenshot for a visual check
```

Your agent reads the screen on *every* step, so read cost dominates. The cleaned tree keeps the meaningful elements with exact positions — far lighter than the raw tree, cheaper than a screenshot. Measured on one paywall screen:

| Screen read | Tokens | vs `noqa screen` |
|---|---:|---:|
| `noqa screen` | ~800 | 1× |
| `noqa screenshot` | ~1,500 | ~2× |
| `noqa screen --full` | ~5,600 | ~7× |

### Actions

Every gesture targets an element two ways. Working out pixel coordinates is error-prone for a coding agent, so it's easier to use automatic grounding — describe the element in plain language and noqa places it on screen.

```bash
noqa action tap -d "Blue login button at the bottom"    # tap
noqa action tap -d "Login button" --double              # double tap
noqa action tap -d "Login button" --duration 2          # long-press, in seconds
noqa action swipe -d "photo carousel, swipe left"       # swipe
noqa action drag -d "card onto the drop zone"           # drag
noqa action input -d "email field" --text "hi@noqa.ai"  # type into a field
```

Or target by coordinates (0–1000, read from `noqa screen`) as a fallback:

```bash
noqa action tap --x 500 --y 320                         # tap
noqa action swipe --x1 500 --y1 800 --x2 500 --y2 200   # swipe between two points
noqa action drag --x1 300 --y1 500 --x2 700 --y2 500    # drag between two points
noqa action input --x 500 --y 640 --text "hi@noqa.ai"   # tap a field and type
```

App and system controls take no target:

```bash
noqa action activate-app --bundle-id com.example.app    # bring an app to the foreground
noqa action terminate-app --bundle-id com.example.app   # force-quit an app
noqa action restart-app --bundle-id com.example.app     # terminate and relaunch
noqa action background-app                              # send the current app to the background
noqa action open-url --url "https://appium.io"          # open a deep link or URL
noqa action alert --action accept                       # accept a system alert (or --action dismiss)
```

## Production-ready testing

Beyond the free CLI, a subscription unlocks noqa's own agent and, for teams, the full platform.

### noqa agent

Our own agent, built specifically for mobile testing rather than a general-purpose model driving a device. Hand it your test cases and it runs them autonomously on the device, returning per-step pass/fail.

- **Fast** — 5–10s per action, dropping to 1–2s on screens it has already seen.
- **Cheaper per action than a frontier LLM API.**
- **Reports** — per-step pass/fail with video and screenshots.

### Agentic QA platform

Everything in the noqa agent, scaled for teams — run the whole suite in the cloud and wire it into your workflow.

- **1000+ cloud devices.**
- **Unlimited seats**, with shared test cases and builds.
- **Integrations** — Slack, Jira, CI/CD, Webhooks, API, MCP server.
- **Priority support.**

## FAQ

**Which devices and platforms are supported?**
iOS and Android — real devices, simulators, and emulators locally, plus cloud devices. noqa drives them through Appium (XCUITest on iOS, UiAutomator2 on Android).

**Which frameworks and engines are supported?**
All of them. noqa works purely from screenshots, so it doesn't depend on how the app is built: native, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, and non-native UI like maps, canvases, WebViews, and ads.

**Do I need to integrate an SDK or change my app?**
No. Nothing to add or change in your app.

**Do I need an account, and do I have to pay?**
An account is required — grounding and test cases run through noqa's servers — but a free one is enough. You only pay to run the noqa agent and use cloud features.

**Does noqa work on Windows or Linux?**
Not yet — the app currently runs only on Mac with Apple Silicon.

**Can I use it with Claude Code / Cursor / Codex?**
Yes, through the CLI. Any coding agent that can run shell commands drives noqa; install the `noqa-testing` skill so it knows the commands.
